As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computerxe2x80x99s hardware.nnHow does Linux differ from other operating systems?nnIn many ways, Linux is similar to other operating systems you may have used before, such as Windows, macOS (formerly OS X), or iOS. Like other operating systems, Linux has a graphical interface, and the same types of software you are accustomed to, such as word processors, photo editors, video editors, and so on. In many cases, a softwarexe2x80x99s creator may have made a Linux version of the same program you use on other systems. In short: if you can use a computer or other electronic device, you can use Linux.nnBut Linux also is different from other operating systems in many important ways. First, and perhaps most importantly, Linux is open source software. The code used to create Linux is free and available to the public to view, edit, andxe2x80x94for users with the appropriate skillsxe2x80x94to contribute to.nnLinux is also different in that, although the core pieces of the Linux operating system are generally common, there are many distributions of Linux, which include different software options. This means that Linux is incredibly customizable, because not just applications, such as word processors and web browsers, can be swapped out. Linux users also can choose core components, such as which system displays graphics, and other user-interface components.nnWho uses Linux?nnYou probably already use Linux, whether you know it or not. Depending on which user survey you look at, between one- and two-thirds of the webpages on the Internet are generated by servers running Linux.nnCompanies and individuals choose Linux for their servers because it's secure, flexible, and you can receive excellent support from a large community of users, in addition to companies like Canonical, SUSE, and Red Hat, each of which offer commercial support.nnMany devices you probably own, such as Android phones and tablets and Chromebooks, digital storage devices, personal video recorders, cameras, wearables, and more, also run Linux. Your car has Linux running under the hood. Even Microsoft Windows features Linux components, as part of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).nnWho xe2x80x9cownsxe2x80x9d Linux?nnBy virtue of its open source licensing, Linux is freely available to anyone. However, the trademark on the name xe2x80x9cLinuxxe2x80x9d rests with its creator, Linus Torvalds. The source code for Linux is under copyright by its many individual authors, and licensed under the GPLv2 license.nnThe term xe2x80x9cLinuxxe2x80x9d technically refers to just the Linux kernel. Most people refer to the entire operating system as "Linux" because to most users an OS includes a bundle of programs, tools, and services (like a desktop, clock, an application menu, and so on). Some people, particularly members of the Free Software Foundation, refer to this collection as GNU/Linux, because many vital tools included are GNU components. However, not all Linux installations use GNU components as a part of the operating system: Android, for example, uses a Linux kernel but relies very little on GNU tools.nnWhat is the difference between Unix and Linux?nnYou may have heard of Unix, which is an operating system developed in the 1970s at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. Unix and Linux are similar in many ways, and in fact, Linux was originally created to be indistinguishable from Unix. Both have similar tools for interfacing with the system, programming tools, filesystem layouts, and other key components. However, not all Unices are free and open source.nnOver the years, a number of different operating systems have been created that attempted to be xe2x80x9cunix-likexe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cunix-compatible,xe2x80x9d but Linux has been the most successful, far surpassing its predecessors in popularity.nnHow was Linux created?nnLinux was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a then-student at the University of Helsinki. Torvalds built Linux as a free and open source alternative to Minix, another Unix clone that was predominantly used in academic settings. He originally intended to name it xe2x80x9cFreax,xe2x80x9d but the administrator of the server Torvalds used to distribute the original code named his directory xe2x80x9cLinuxxe2x80x9d after a combination of Torvaldsxe2x80x99 first name and the word Unix, and the name stuck.nnnnnLinux cheat sheetsnnnnnnnnLinux networkingntSELinuxntAdvanced Linux commands for developersntFirewallsnnnnnnnnnHow can I get started using Linux?nnTherexe2x80x99s some chance youxe2x80x99re using Linux already and donxe2x80x99t know it, but if youxe2x80x99d like to install Linux on your home computer to try it out, the easiest way is to pick a popular distribution designed for your platform (for example, laptop or tablet device) and give it a try. Although there are numerous distributions available, most of the older, well-known distributions are good choices for beginners because they have large user communities that can help answer questions if you get stuck or canxe2x80x99t figure things out. Popular distributions include Elementary OS, Fedora, Mint, and Ubuntu, but there are many others. It's a common saying that the best Linux distro is the one that works best on your computer, so try a few to see which one best suits your hardware and your style of working.nnYou can install Linux on your current computer (be sure to back-up your data first), or you can buy a System76 or Purism computer with Linux already installed. If you're not looking for the fastest computing experience possible, you can also install Linux on old computers, or buy a Raspberry Pi.nnOnce you've installed Linux, read our article on how to install applications on Linux, and check back often for news and tutorials on all the best applications open source has to offer. Ultimately, getting started with Linux is a matter of getting started with Linux. The sooner you try it, the sooner you'll get comfortable with it, and eventually you'll blissfully forget that non-open operating systems exist!nnHow can I contribute to Linux?nnMost of the Linux kernel is written in the C programming language, with a little bit of assembly and other languages sprinkled in. If youxe2x80x99re interested in writing code for the Linux kernel itself, a good place to get started is in thexc2xa0Kernel Newbies FAQ, which will explain some of the concepts and processes youxe2x80x99ll want to be familiar with.nnBut the Linux community is much more than the kernel, and needs contributions from lots of other people besides programmers. Every distribution contains hundreds or thousands of programs that can be distributed along with it, and each of these programs, as well as the distribution itself, need a variety of people and skill sets to make them successful, including:nnTesters to make sure everything works on different configurations of hardware and software, and to report the bugs when it does not.ntDesigners to create user interfaces and graphics distributed with various programs.ntWriters who can create documentation, how-tos, and other important text distributed with software.ntTranslators to take programs and documentation from their native languages and make them accessible to people around the world.ntPackagers to take software programs and put all the parts together to make sure they run flawlessly in different distributions.ntEnthusiasts to spread the word about Linux and open source in general.ntAnd of course developers to write the software itself.nWhere can I learn more about Linux?nnOpensource.com has a huge archive of Linux-related articles.
